<!-- Reference types are consisted of:

Object (Array and Function are object)
Array
Function
If we add reference value to the deps array, we should keep in mind that useEffectwill run when the reference is changed — Reference points to the object’s location in memory. Reference is changed every time render occurs.

In other words, useEffect runs even though the object value(e.g. user.name) is still the same. useEffect uses shallow equality comparison to identify whether dependencies are updated. -->

<!-- Design questions
1. If you have to call 5 api's to load a page then how will you do it ? 1. Promise.all 2. async await
2. Design a weater page which fetches data from 30 api's for 30 cities. How will you do it ? can network bandwidth handle that many API calls
3. If you are calling 5 api's in promise.all . the execution context becomes empty, how does the browser maintain the connection. -> system threads etc.
4. if you have to submit a form but also in places where internet is not available, how will you handle it ? -> local storage, service workers. 1. you need to cache jss/js files
5. 2. how will you handle update of form when internet is not available. -> use a queue to keep on adding data and once internet is on then data will be pushed to the server.
6. design a medical center kind of onboarding application with concurreny users/multiple users trying to book at the same time
7. design a hierarchy kind of application for giving loans like carbon card.
8. develop a movie theatre booking system to book seats like bookmyshow
9. develop login modal with signup and local storage etc.
10. develop a container with 300px and child elements like hashtags. show the container with elements that fit + the remaining elements -> useBoundingClientRect
11. Ifram open in a separate route (client route) and communicate with it.
12. Code a comment section with add edit reply and sorting
14. Code a alertTracker component using HOC and Context API to show if a paramete is out of range like O2, BP, Sugar etc.
15. Code -> Fetch data from an API and filter it using some input from user.
16. Code immutable js question like set/add/ remove etc -> weird interview
17. Implement your own thorottle and debounce functions
18. Fetch data from an API / use const data to display table with Name, Age, Id and on clicking on the headers show the table with sorting based on that header
// Write a pollyfill for promise in javascript
// are async await part of javascript or are they part of ES6?
// how async await or Promise.then/catch work under the hood ? -> they become switch statements
// can a promise have multiple resolve/reject and if yes then what will happen
// difference between javascript and ecmascript
// are enums part of javascript

<!--
    We work
    async await
     [1,2,3,4]] -> 5 -> [[1,4],[2,3]]  = all substring where sum is equal to a number
     html/css -> make all properties in 180px container with each block(3) 60px and 1px margin get contained inside it without overflowing
     html/css -> make them aligned diagonally
     react -> redux vs context. context all the places where data is subscribed is updated
     class / func components. when to use class components
